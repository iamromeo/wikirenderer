WikiRenderer is a library to generate HTML (or anything else) from wiki content.


You can install it from Composer. See [the page on Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/jelix/wikirenderer)


Warning: the master branch is currently unstable since we rework many things.
Got to the 3.x branch to have a stable release. Documentation is not updated yet also.


English and french documentation is on http://wikirenderer.jelix.org
